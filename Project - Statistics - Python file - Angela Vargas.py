# #### Using one quantitive response variable: FWI, and Four quantitative explanatory variables: Temperature, RH, WS, and Rain.

# ### DataFrame From Data and Print: Selecting only the Variables Chosen for the Project.

fire = pd.read_csv('Algerian_forest_fires_dataset_UPDATE.csv', 
                   usecols = ['Temperature', 'RH','Ws','Rain','FWI','Classes'], 
                   low_memory = True)
fire


# In[3]:


# Now, it is needed to check the NaN or missing values columns
fire.isnull().sum()


# In[4]:


fire.dropna(subset=['Classes'], inplace=True)
print(fire)


# In[5]:


# Now, it is needed to check the NaN or missing values columns again
fire.isnull().sum()

#Convert Dtype to numeric values depending of the columns values:

# The astype() function can take a dictionary of column names and data types:
# Manually writing the type of each column, Creating the DataFrame:

col_type = {
    'FWI': 'float'
}
# Creating a single dictionary with values to replace:
clean_dict = {'%': '', 'âˆ’': '-', '\(est\)': ''}

#Replacing the data to the new fire dataframe with new dtypes:

fire = fire.replace(clean_dict, regex=True).replace({'-n/a ': np.nan}).astype(col_type)

fire.info()

#Cleaning data with normalize:

#Other way to clean data is normalize to clean the %
    #The following will clean all the text values

from unicodedata import normalize

def clean_normalize_whitespace(x):
    if isinstance(x, str):
        return normalize('NFKC', x).strip()
    else:
        return x

#To run this function on the entire DataFrame using map

fire = fire.map(clean_normalize_whitespace)


# ##### Comments: it was removed only one row that belongs to a missing value for classes since I am not able to update or get the correct information to fill that missing space. It will help to calculate statistic measures to all values with a better accuracy. Also, I converted the data of FWI column into float as they were read as string but in reality those are numeric decimals data type. At the end, I cleaned all data spaces that are causing differences between the same value due spaces in string data.

# #### Analysis of Coefficients Base on Estimates, Coefficient of Determination, and Hypothesis Testing for Quantitive Variables:

# ##### A = FWI, and B = Temperature/RH/WS/Rain
# ##### For a significance level of 0.05 or 95% confidence.
# 
# ##### Coefficient of Determination for the model is 0.477, which means that the model is showing the proportion for the prediction of the FWI for a regression model analysis, the 47% of the total variation of the FWI occurs because of the variation of Temperature, RH, Ws, and Rain. And, there are space for error due randomless and weak explanation of the data to get the response FWI variable. 
# ##### Temperature and WS variables have positive estimate coefficientes: 0.6701 and 0.6629 respectively, which means that both have a positive relation, if these two variables increase, the FWI and others are increasing by these coefficients as well.
# ##### On the other hand, RH and Rain have negative number: -0.1960 and -0.6457, which means that if these variables increase the other FWI variable will decrease by these coefficients, so these two variables have a negative coefficient relation with FWI.
# ##### In terms of Hypotesis Testing:
# ##### For Temperature (Ho: B = 0, versus H1 â‰  0), the t is 5.06 and the p-value is 0 < 0.05, it rejects the null hypotesis and is a positive relation. 
# ##### For RH (Ho: B = 0, versus H1 â‰  0), the t  is -6.2985 and p-value is 0 < 0.05, it rejects the null hypotesis and is a negative relation.
# ##### For Ws (Ho: B = 0, versus H1 â‰  0), the t  is 5.0846 and p-value is 0 < 0.05, it rejects the null hypotesis and is a positve relation.
# ##### For Rain (Ho: B = 0, versus H1 â‰  0), the t is -3.4907 and p-value is 0.0006 < 0.05, it rejects the null hypotesis and is a negative relation.
# ##### In conclusion, the model denotes that a 47% of total variation of FWI occurs for the 4 variables, there are some relation but some of them is non-linear and have negative correlation, the hypotesis test for all of the explanatory variables B reject the null hypotesis H=0, so it means all of them have a correlation with FWI.
